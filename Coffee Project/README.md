In this project, I analysed data from the "coffee_db" database, which includes three key tables: Customers, Orders, and Products. The goal was to derive valuable insights to optimize sales strategies and improve operational efficiency.

### 1. Project Insights:
ðŸ”¶ Identified customers without email and phone numbers for better CRM strategies.

ðŸ”¶ Analysed the total stock of every coffee type to improve inventory management.

ðŸ”¶ Created a coffee price breakdown by type with percent contribution for pricing insights.

ðŸ”¶ Explored yearly order distribution with total orders and contribution percentage to track sales performance.

ðŸ”¶ Highlighted the top 5 active customers and ordered products for targeted marketing.

### 2. Technical Skills Used:
ðŸ”· Created primary keys and foreign keys for table relationships.
ðŸ”· Handled missing data by filling empty values in the customer table.
ðŸ”· Utilized predefined functions like CONCAT(), COUNT(), ROUND() for data manipulation.
ðŸ”· Implemented subqueries for complex data retrieval.
ðŸ”· Leveraged window functions for ranking and aggregated insights.

###3. Project Outcome:
ðŸŽ¯ Improved data integrity and enhanced customer profiling.
